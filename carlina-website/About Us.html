            <h2>Carlina is an experienced journalist in fashion. Born in Italy, she graduated in 2010 and started working as an intern for Giorgio Armani. In her free time, she kept what she called her "fashion diary". In it she wrote reviews about fashion shows and lifestyle tips. That's how she had the idea for this website where she works with fashion experts who write articles about the latest fashion trends. </h2>
